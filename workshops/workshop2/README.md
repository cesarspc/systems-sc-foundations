## Mathematical Model
State representation of Wumpus World:

$s_t=(x,y,b,s,g,a,w,t)$

**Variables that define the system state**

$x$: X coordinate

$y$: Y cordinate

$b$: Binary percept forbreeze percept

$s$: Binary percept for stentch

$g$: Binary percept for glitter

$a$: Is arrow available?

$w$: Is Wumpus alive?

$t$: Time step
